    <h2>Simple Macaroni and Cheese</h2>
    <p>
      A very quick and easy fix to a tasty side-dish. Fancy, designer mac and
      cheese often costs forty or fifty dollars to prepare when you have so many
      exotic and expensive cheeses, but they aren't always the best tasting.
      This recipe is cheap and tasty.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) box elbow macaroni</li>
      <li>¼ cup butter</li>
      <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni
        in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but
        firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; stir in flour, salt, and
        pepper until smooth, about 5 minutes. Slowly pour milk into butter-flour
        mixture while continuously stirring until mixture is smooth and
        bubbling, about 5 minutes. Add Cheddar cheese to milk mixture and stir
        until cheese is melted, 2 to 4 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Fold macaroni into cheese sauce until coated.</li>
